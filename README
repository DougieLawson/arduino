This is a collection of a few of the Arduino projects I thought it was worth sharing.

1. DCF77
   My version of J.M. Lietaer's code for decoding a pollin DCF77 receiver.

2. Ethernet
   A demo of sending a tweet and publishing on MQTT

3. bcd 
   An experiment with binary coded decimal

4. one to 19
   An example of driving a +/-1 and 7 segment display without a multiplexer chip.

5. MQTT_colour_LED
   Set the multi-colour LED from a web page. Transport is MQTT
