This is a collection of a few of the Arduino projects I thought it was worth sharing.

1. DCF77
   My version of J.M. Lietaer's code for decoding a pollin DCF77 receiver.

2. bcd 
   An experiment with binary coded decimal

3. one to 19
   An example of driving a +/-1 and 7 segment display without a multiplexer chip.

All code is GPL v3 unless otherwise stated.
